I am new to programming and this is my first mod. I am using Fabric API and version 1.20.1.
This mod introduces the RPG system of attributes, the leveling of which allows you to open the possibility of attacking with weapons and wearing armor. With the help of json files, you can add new items and customize them, which is convenient for introducing the mod into the RPG collection of mods, which was originally planned.
Perhaps for vanilla use, this mod will be boring and you will be right, so I advise you to make mods collections with it.
